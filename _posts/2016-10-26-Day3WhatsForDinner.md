It's my third day of this project, and I'm not sure if I can keep this up.  I'm learning as I go along.  Spending a few hours reading about HTML and CSS at this point and then trying to make a page by trial and error.  I specifically have not used any Javascript at this point as I want to make sure I understand all the functionality of HTML (including HTML5) and CSS3 before getting into more dynamic stuff.

Initially, I wanted to use an unordered list, but for some reaons my code wasn't behaving.  I initially tried to use 

<!-- li ul {
       display: nonoe;
}
li : hover>ul {
    display: block;
} -->

But it wouldn't come out right at all, so I used a different approach.

Bon appetit!
