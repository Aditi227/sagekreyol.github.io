I've spent the day trying to create an interactive page using absolutely no Javascript.  I suspect my pages will be pretty boring until I learn that, but I really want to get through CSS and HTML first.  Based on what I can find, the only way to move items without using Javascript is via the CSS Transform:translate function.  While other 2 dimensional functions like skew, rotate and scale can move an object around a central point of origin, the translate function actually moves an object from one place to the other.  If I knew more code, I could try to simulate motion by having an item move from starting place to place 1 followed by place 2 and so on.  Unfortunately, the way to trigger the event in HTML is by using a binary click function (either on or off), so once I click off, the object moves back to its starting position.
