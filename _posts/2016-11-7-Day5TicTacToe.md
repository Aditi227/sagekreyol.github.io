Ok, I've skipped a few days.  I've had to spend a lot more time reading about Javascript in order to make pages interactive.  CSS and HTML are great for static pages, but the exercise in the spinning image taught me that you need Javascript in order to really make something that a user can engage with.

Tic Tac Toe is a very basic game that most people are familiar with.  For the next couple of days, I'll probably do similar things along this same line.  Thanks to a very good tutorial by Timothy James and http://www.coding4.us/html-and-javascript/tic-tac-toe-game

*Note - I've discovered a bug that I can't figure out.  My game works doesn't work if O moves first and wins along either diagonal.
